# Football-results-API

### API created with express, serverless and deployed on AWS API Gateway.

In order to send some football data to the client side of football results application, I've decided to built an API by myself.

To do that:
- Create a server with Node and Express, then, created some JSON data files.
- Create some GET routes to access the data.
- Configure a CORS middleware
- Install serverless and aws-serverless-express
- Configure a lambda file and a .yml file to deploy the API on AWS API Gateway
- Deploy and that's it!

As I created this API I have to update it regularly.
